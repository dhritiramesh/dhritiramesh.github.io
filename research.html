            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>This project explored the integration of large language models (LLMs) into educational environments, focusing on prompt engineering for enhanced learning experiences. Using the <strong>llama.cpp</strong> framework, I evaluated reproducibility and latency across various LLaMA model sizes to determine their practical classroom potential. Findings demonstrated the importance of fine-tuned prompts and contextual grounding to ensure consistent, accurate, and bias-reduced educational responses.</p>
            <h4>Journey</h4>
            <p>Working with a PhD researcher at the Colorado School of Mines, I dove into LLM optimization, testing model behavior across multiple configurations. Through iterative experimentation and Python scripting, I developed an appreciation for reproducibility/latency challenges in AI, inspiring my broader interest in accessible and ethical AI systems for education.</p>

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>This paper discusses the process used to study the motion of the Mars-crossing Asteroid 5066 Garradd
(1990 MA) and the process used to redetermine and confirm its orbit. The study included determining
the asteroid's position on five observation nights spread throughout the months of June and July 2025.
Using the positions of 5066 Garradd during three of these observations, the position (with respect to
the Sun) and velocity vectors were calculated via the Method of Gauss. With these vectors, the six
orbital elements - the semi-major axis (a), eccentricity (e), inclination i), longitude of the ascending
node (S), argument of perihelion (w), and time of perihelion passage (T) - were calculated through a
series of mathematical processes as well as their corresponding uncertainties found from the calculated
standard deviation using the Monte Carlo method. These elements were found to be a = 1.937±
0.002 AU, e = 0.1550 ± 0.0005, i = 41.48° ± 0.02° , П = 82.266° ± 0.009° , w = 184.70° ± 0.09,
T = 2459893 ± 1, and the mean anomaly on 2025-July-06 was found to be 354.38° ±
0.07°. The orbital elements were later used to determine the asteroid's orbit. Consistency checks were
successful, as the use of such orbital elements produced an accurate ephemeris (R.A. and Decl.) for
the remaining two observations.</p>
            <h4>Journey</h4>
            <p>This was my first exposure to intensive scientific research — coding in Python late into the night, learning new math and physics concepts, and collaborating with peers from around the world. It strengthened my desire to blend computation with physical sciences and taught me how scientific curiosity drives discovery.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>This ongoing project focuses on using accessible technology to improve awareness of anemia and nutritional deficiencies. Through app-based self-assessments, educational modules, and symptom tracking, the tool aims to empower individuals — especially young women — with proactive health insights.</p>
            <h4>Journey</h4>
            <p>I began this project after learning about global health disparities related to iron deficiency. Combining my interests in computer science and biology, I designed early app prototypes and researched how user-centered interfaces could improve engagement with health education. The project continues to evolve as I explore ways to integrate AI-driven analysis and expand impact through outreach.</p>
