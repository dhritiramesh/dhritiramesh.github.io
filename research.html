          <h3>Prompt Engineering and Large Language Model Optimization for Education</h3>

          <p>Exploring prompt engineering strategies in Meta’s LLaMA models to improve educational reliability, reproducibility, and latency performance in AI-assisted learning environments.</p>

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>This poster discusses the evaluation of prompt engineering strategies in large language models (LLMs) through an analysis of response accuracy, reproducibility, and latency across multiple model variants. The study included 174 prompt-response trials across ten categories, including logic, mathematics, and language interpretation, administered to three versions of Meta's LLaMA models (1B, 3B, and 8B parameters). Each trial measured response accuracy, reproducibility, and latency (using Python code to quantify the latter two systematically) to assess how model scale influences both output quality and computational efficiency. Results reveal distinct scaling patterns: the LLaMA 8B model achieved the highest accuracy (75.86%) and reproducibility (0.38) but demonstrated longer latency (24.27 seconds on average), whereas smaller models responded faster but with lower accuracy (24.14% for 1B and 44.83% for 3B). Across all models, the average accuracy was 48.28%, reproducibility 0.35, and mean latency 14.78 seconds. These findings highlight a measurable trade-off between reasoning reliability and computational speed. The significance of this work extends to education, where LLMs are increasingly integrated as teaching, tutoring, and assessment tools.</p>
            <h4>Journey</h4>
            <p>I began this project through cold-emailing local professors, which led to a mentorship under a Mines PhD student and a Professor. Initially working on reproducibility metrics, I expanded my work to explore the educational implications of Large Language Models. Currently, my work is pending publication and acceptance to present at conferences, including the Special Interest Group in Computer Science Education Technical Symposium 2026.</p>

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>This paper discusses the process used to study the motion of the Mars-crossing Asteroid 5066 Garradd (1990 MA) and the process used to redetermine and confirm its orbit. The study included determining the asteroid's position on five observation nights spread throughout the months of June and July 2025. Using the positions of 5066 Garradd during three of these observations, the position (with respect to the Sun) and velocity vectors were calculated via the Method of Gauss. The six orbital elements and corresponding uncertainties were computed using the Monte Carlo method. These elements were later used to determine the asteroid's orbit, with consistency checks confirming an accurate ephemeris for the remaining two observations.</p>
            <h4>Journey</h4>
            <p>This project was made possible through my participation in the Summer Science Program (SSP), where I collaborated with peers from around the world and mentors in astronomy and physics. I learned celestial mechanics, orbital dynamics, and applied advanced mathematics using Python scripts for data analysis and orbit simulation — demonstrating how computer science can advance research in astrophysics.</p>

          <h3>Anemia Early Detection App</h3>
          <p class="research-sub">Congressional App Challenge Submission • 2025</p>
          <p>Developed a mobile app integrating a CNN model to detect anemia risk from non-invasive conjunctiva images, enhancing accessibility to early screening tools.</p>

            <h4>Overview</h4>
            <p>Developed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model and mobile application designed to detect potential signs of anemia through non-invasive image analysis of the human conjunctiva (the inner eyelid). The app processes user-submitted images to assess pallor and color distribution, providing a probability-based estimate of anemia risk. This project aims to make early screening more accessible, particularly in regions lacking medical infrastructure or diagnostic tools and especially for young women who are especially susceptible to anemia.</p>
            <h4>Journey</h4>
            <p>This project stemmed from my passion for combining computer science and healthcare to solve real-world problems. Working with a peer, we trained a CNN model using a curated dataset of conjunctiva images to recognize color variations linked to anemia. Alongside developing the app interface, I collaborated with mentors in both medicine and machine learning to ensure ethical and accurate model use. Currently, the app is being evaluated by the Congressional App Challenge, though it remains unpublished due to data confidentiality.</p>
