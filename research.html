            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>This poster discusses the evaluation of prompt engineering strategies in large language models (LLMs) through an analysis of response accuracy, reproducibility, and latency across multiple model
variants. The study included 174 prompt-response trials across ten
categories, including logic, mathematics, and language interpretation, administered to three versions of Meta's LLaMA models
(1B, 3B, and 8B parameters). Each trial measured response accuracy, reproducibility, and latency (using Python code to quantify
the latter two systematically) to assess how model scale influences
both output quality and computational efficiency. Results reveal
distinct scaling patterns: the LLaMA 8B model achieved the highest accuracy (75.86%) and reproducibility (0.38) but demonstrated
longer latency (24.27 seconds on average), whereas smaller mod-
els responded faster but with lower accuracy (24.14% for 1B and
44.83% for 3B). Across all models, the average accuracy was 48.28%,
reproducibility 0.35, and mean latency 14.78 seconds. These findings highlight a measurable trade-off between reasoning reliability
and computational speed. The significance of this work extends
to computing education, where LLMs are increasingly integrated
as teaching, tutoring, and assessment tools. Understanding how
prompt design and model scale affect the consistency of generated
responses is critical for developing trustworthy and transparent
educational Al systems. By analyzing LLM behavior across structured prompts, this study provides insight into how educators and
developers can optimize model interactions for classroom learning,
automated feedback, and equitable evaluation.</p>
            <h4>Journey</h4>
            <p>Working with a PhD researcher at the Colorado School of Mines, I dove into LLM optimization, testing model behavior across multiple configurations. Through iterative experimentation and Python scripting, I developed an appreciation for reproducibility/latency challenges in AI, inspiring my broader interest in accessible and ethical AI systems for education. Currently, this project is pending publication.</p>

            <h4>Abstract</h4>
            <p>This paper discusses the process used to study the motion of the Mars-crossing Asteroid 5066 Garradd
(1990 MA) and the process used to redetermine and confirm its orbit. The study included determining
the asteroid's position on five observation nights spread throughout the months of June and July 2025.
Using the positions of 5066 Garradd during three of these observations, the position (with respect to
the Sun) and velocity vectors were calculated via the Method of Gauss. With these vectors, the six
orbital elements - the semi-major axis (a), eccentricity (e), inclination i), longitude of the ascending
node (S), argument of perihelion (w), and time of perihelion passage (T) - were calculated through a
series of mathematical processes as well as their corresponding uncertainties found from the calculated
standard deviation using the Monte Carlo method. These elements were found to be a = 1.937±
0.002 AU, e = 0.1550 ± 0.0005, i = 41.48° ± 0.02° , П = 82.266° ± 0.009° , w = 184.70° ± 0.09,
T = 2459893 ± 1, and the mean anomaly on 2025-July-06 was found to be 354.38° ±
0.07°. The orbital elements were later used to determine the asteroid's orbit. Consistency checks were
successful, as the use of such orbital elements produced an accurate ephemeris (R.A. and Decl.) for
the remaining two observations.</p>
            <h4>Journey</h4>
            <p>This was my first exposure to intensive scientific research — coding in Python late into the night, learning new math and physics concepts, and collaborating with peers from around the world. It strengthened my desire to blend computation with physical sciences and taught me how scientific curiosity drives discovery.</p>

            <p>This ongoing project focuses on using accessible technology to improve awareness of anemia and nutritional deficiencies. Through app-based self-assessments, educational modules, and symptom tracking, the tool aims to empower individuals — especially young women — with proactive health insights.</p>
            <h4>Journey</h4>
            <p>I began this project after learning about global health disparities related to iron deficiency. Combining my interests in computer science and biology, I designed early app prototypes and researched how user-centered interfaces could improve engagement with health education. The project continues to evolve as I explore ways to integrate AI-driven analysis and expand impact through outreach.</p>
